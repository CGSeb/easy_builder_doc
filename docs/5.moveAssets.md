# 5. Move assets

The move mode is very simple, click on the asset you want to move and press M. Left click to validate the position.

All the available shortcuts are at the bottom and most of them are the same as the add mode.

!!! info
    If you want to take avantage of the grid system from Easy Builder, use the M shortcut and not G like you would normally do.
    If you want to move an asset freely, press S to switch of the snap tool and the asset will follow your mouse and stay at the same height.
