# 6. Add a floor

When adding a new floor to a build, you will be asked if you want to set the height with a value or manually by moving the mouse.

It works the same way as [adding a ceiling](4.addAssets.md#ceiling). The value mode will automatically calculate the default height to be on top of the previous floor, taking in consideration the height of the ceiling and the selected asset in the NPanel.

!!! warning
    Make sure you select the asset you want to use for the floor before adding a new floor, the height of the selected asset will be used in the default height so the floor is not going into the ceiling of the previous floor.
